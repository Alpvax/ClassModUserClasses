# ClassModUserClasses
<p>User specific Classes. Depends on ClassModCore, which in turn depends on AlpCore.</p>
<p>In order to build and debug with the current (local) version of ClassModCore, the classpathentry /ClassModCore has been added with access rules disallowing anything but the api package on the build path. Feel free to leave this entry off your classpath</p>
